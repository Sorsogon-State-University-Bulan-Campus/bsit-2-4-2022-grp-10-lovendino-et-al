# Cosmology ‚ú®

Cosmology is a branch of astronomy that involves the origin and evolution of the universe, from the Big Bang to today and on into the future. According to NASA, the definition of cosmology is "the scientific study of the large scale properties of the universe as a whole."

Cosmology aims to study the world being able to explain it in its totality, which is impossible from the fact that it is impossible doing experience of all phenomena in their entirety, but only of some of them. Therefore metaphysicians, when they try to explain the universe, they fall into contradictory rational procedures with themselves (antinomies).

## FAQ ‚ùî

#### Question 1
Why do we need to be familiar with the concept of cosmology?

#### Question 2
What is the purpose of cosmology?

Cosmology deals with the physical situation that is the context in the large for human existence--the universe has such a nature that our life is possible. This means that although it is a physical science, it is of particular importance in terms of its implications for human life.

#### Question 3
What is an ecample of cosmology?

An example of cosmology is the study of the big bang theory. The scientific study of the origin, evolution, and structure of the universe. A philosophical, religious, or mythical explanation of the nature and structure of the universe.
