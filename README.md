# Cosmology ✨

Cosmology is a branch of astronomy that involves the origin and evolution of the universe, from the Big Bang to today and on into the future. According to NASA, the definition of cosmology is "the scientific study of the large scale properties of the universe as a whole."


## FAQ ❔

#### Question 1
Why do we need to be familiar with the concept of cosmology?

As cosmology involves the origin of the universe, we must know a little about the nature of the cosmos we live. Once we know the basic concepts of cosmology, we can understand who we are and where we came from. 


#### Question 2
What is the purpose of cosmology?

Cosmology deals with the physical situation that is the context in the large for human existence--the universe has such a nature that our life is possible. This means that although it is a physical science, it is of particular importance in terms of its implications for human life.
