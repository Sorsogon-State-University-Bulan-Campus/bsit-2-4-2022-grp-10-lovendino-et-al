Cosmology is a branch of astronomy that involves the origin and evolution of the universe, from the Big Bang to today and on into the future. According to NASA, the definition of cosmology is "the scientific study of the large scale properties of the universe as a whole."

Cosmology aims to study the world being able to explain it in its totality, which is impossible from the fact that it is impossible doing experience of all phenomena in their entirety, but only of some of them. Therefore metaphysicians, when they try to explain the universe, they fall into contradictory rational procedures with themselves (antinomies).

## Types of Cosmology üìù

### Physical Cosmology 
- Incorporating physics, astrophysics, and astronomy
### Religious Cosmology
- involving origin stories and mythologies from religious traditions
### Metaphysical Cosmology
- dealing with questions beyond science such as the cause of the origin of the universe, whether its existence is necessary, whether it has a purpose, its ultimate composition, and even the nature of consciousness, without requiring a religious tradition
### Esoteric Cosmology
- a subset of mythological cosmology that is an intrinsic part of philosophies which have an occult system of thought, based on esoteric knowledge

## Metaphysicians Who Tried to Explain the Universe üë®‚Äçüî¨

### Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) üë®

- The Earth loses its privileged position of the center of the universe and is replaced by the Sun: a scandalous novelty but this still tied to ancient Greek heliocentric cosmology of Aristarchus of Samos, according to which planets move with orderly harmony making uniform circular motions with the Sun at the center of the cosmos.

###  Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) üë®üèª
- A Danish astronomer and once called also in Italian Tycho, tried to overcome these limitations of the Copernican system by advancing the idea of a system, which took the name of tychonic system, in which the planets revolve around the Sun, that in turn rotates around an immobile Earth.

### Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) üßëüèª
-  A disciple of Brahe, showed the central position of the Sun and Galilei (1564-1642), removed the solar system its centrality in the universe by putting it on a par with endless other systems of the Galaxy.

### Isaac Newton (1643-1727) üßìüèº
- explained by the law of gravity movements of the planets around the sun that William Herschel (1738-1822) extended to the whole universe by granting the Sun a movement within the galaxy.
## FAQ ‚ùî

#### Question 1
### Why do we need to be familiar with the concept of cosmology?

As cosmology involves the origin of the universe, we must know a little about the nature of the cosmos we live. Once we know the basic concepts of cosmology, we can understand who we are and where we came from. 


#### Question 2
### What is the purpose of cosmology?

Cosmology deals with the physical situation that is the context in the large for human existence--the universe has such a nature that our life is possible. This means that although it is a physical science, it is of particular importance in terms of its implications for human life.

#### Question 3
### What is an example of cosmology?

An example of cosmology is the study of the big bang theory. The scientific study of the origin, evolution, and structure of the universe. A philosophical, religious, or mythical explanation of the nature and structure of the universe.

#### Question 4
### What does a cosmologist do?

Cosmologists are interested in the formation, evolution and future of the universe and its constituents. Most objects we can see with telescopes are large or exist at extreme distances (e.g. planets, stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies and even superclusters).
